    <P>For my fiirst image I chose Solange Knowles. She is a perfect example of a fearless, yet soft black woman. A live example of what it is to write your own life story and change the narritive, being proud and ceratain of who you are. She is a visionary, a limitless dreamer and that is what I aspire to be.</P>
    <h1>MOONLIGHT-(2016)</h1>
    <center>

    <p>This is a still from the 2016 film, Moonlight by Barry Jenkins. It won Best Picture on the 2016 Oscar Aacdemy awards. It has calm deep yet cold tones in its cinematography. Beautfully written with intention to evoke emotion, it is one of my most favoured pieces to watch and indluge in.</p>
    <h1>bell hooks</h1>
    <center>
        <img src="bell-hooks-books.jpeg" alt="">
    </center>
    <p>These are some of my favourite books from one of my favourite writers. I believe everyone from all works of life should at east read one book from bell hooks' catalogue. She will rock your world and make you question yourself and everyone around you, but all with goood intentions.</p>
